Testing and analysis,Evaluation,-,,,FALSE,-,Revisiting and Improving Retrieval-Augmented Deep Assertion Generation,"‚Ä¢ RQ1: What are the characteristics of the dataset? We first
perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset. In particular,
we analyze the distribution of assertion lengths on the
entire dataset. Next, for each Test-Assertion Pair TAPi in
the test set, we retrieve the assertion from the training set
whose corresponding focal-test has the highest similarity
to the focus-test of TAPi and compute the edit distance
between the assertion of TAPi and the retrieved assertion. Such investigation not only validates the dataset‚Äôs
characteristics but also helps us comprehend the intrinsic
association between TAPs and their similar instances,
which can guide our method design (see Section IV).
‚Ä¢ RQ2: Where and why does Integration work? We further
explore the advantages of Integration for assertion generation. We first classify the results generated by Integration
according to the assertion generation method used. Next,
we analyze the assertions that are generated correctly.
‚Ä¢ RQ3: Where and why does Integration fail? We investigate the weaknesses of Integration, which are critical
in that understanding the application scenario of an
approach can better help us apply it in practice [33].
