Testing and analysis,Knowledge-seeking,0,0,,FALSE,B3,Out of Context: How important is Local Context in Neural Program Repair?,"RQ1. How important is local context for repair success? We study multiple context sizes, ranging from a single line up to 28 lines on both sides (56 lines) on three datasets (MegaDiff [21], TSSB [29], and ManySStuBs4J [10], see Table 1), totalling several hundreds of thousands of bugs. 
RQ2. Howdodifferentbugtypesandcomplexity(numberofchanges) respond to different context sizes and context window positions? Both, MaySStuBs4J [10] andTSSM-3M[29]classifybugsinto several bug types or bug patterns. We use this bug type labels to analyze how context size affects repair success for bugs of different types. We perform a similar analysis also for the number of changes of a bugfix. 
RQ3. What is the optimal context window position? In other words, given a fixed context budget, how should it be divided among pre-context and post-context? We experiment with six different context window positions (for four different context window sizes), from only pre-context over several combinations to only post-context. 
RQ4. Is there a connection between the model size (number of parameters), the number of sampled fix candidates and context? With more context, the amount of fix ingredients increases. Wehypothesize that in order to fully exploit context, model size should increase, as should the number of samples. We investigate if this is indeed the case.",,,"Julian Prenner, Romain Robbes",No URL available

Answer: Access to a code suggestion makes participants much more likely to submit a patch. A correct suggestion helps successfully repair defects (93.3% of participants did so). Access to a deceptive suggestion hurts that ability (67.5% of participants submitted overfitting patches in these situations). 
RQ2: Howdoes APR affect debugging success? Answer: Access to a correct APR suggestion increases participant debugging success by 14,000%, compared to having access to only tests. Meanwhile access to a deceptive APR 1While this conclusion is counterintuitive, its possible explanations include that fault localization tools “ignore [and fail to support] the fact that understanding the root cause of a failure typically involves complex activities, such as navigating program dependencies and rerunning the program with different inputs” [61] and “interference between the mechanism of automated fault localization and the actual assistance needed by programmers in debugging” [88]. 2The experimental protocol was approved by the UMass Amherst IRB, protocol #4298. suggestion decreases that success by 65%. Correct suggestions are far more likely to help produce correct patches than deceptive suggestions are to hinder producing them. 
RQ3: Howdocode suggestions affect debugging time? Answer: Access to correct suggestions speeds up debugging, as compared to access to deceptive suggestions or no suggestions at all. 
RQ4: Howcan the effect of deceptive suggestions be mitigated? Answer: Participants recognize that deceptive suggestions are oflowerqualitythancorrectones, but67.5%oftheparticipants still submit an overfitting patchwhengivenadeceptive suggestion. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that programming experience improved the ability to recognize deceptive suggestions, submit patches, submit correct patches, or debug faster.",,,"Hadeel Eladawy, Claire Le Goues, Yuriy Brun",No URL available
