To provide a reference for subsequent evaluations, we f irst evaluate the performance of various detectors on malware detection and Android software multi-category classification. 
RQ2: Howdodifferent detectors perform on obfuscated samples? We evaluate the resilience of various detectors to different obfuscation techniques and analyze the factors that contribute to their differences in resilience. 
RQ3: Howdoes concept drift affect the various detectors? Toevaluatetheabilityofdifferentdetectorstoalleviateconceptdrift, we conduct our experiments in two scenarios, including Android software evolution and new malware category emergence.
